    excerpt: "My first major 3D origami work was the peacock which has about 18 tails of different shapes and sizes.  The body of the peacock needs to be curved to give the shape of the bird.  The legs and the feathers have to be positioned correctly such that it won't flip over while standing."

    excerpt: "My favorite must be Mario and Luigi.  They are taller than the rest of my origami figures.  Their big noses are prominent on their faces along with their signature mustaches and hats."

    excerpt: "I like this dragon origami because it's the first one where I learned to curve a long string of pieces into the wavy shape.  The floating waves around the body give the illusion of the dragon flying through the cloud."

    excerpt: "My most recent creations are the Power Rangers. *Go Go Power Rangers*. I tried to replicate the color, the height, and the eyes of each Power Ranger."

Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. 

I am a big fan of origami since I started folding my first crane as a kid. In highschool, while most students' Easter project was colored eggs, mine was an origami forest with rabbits, deers, birds, and trees.

To finish an origami piece requires intricacies and dedication to go through each minute step. Recently I learn about 3D origami which is very different from traditional origami. With 3D origami, the base piece is simple to make. The complexity comes from putting together hundreds or thousands of those base pieces into one origami figure.

Below are my 3D origami creations.

# Superheroes

* Many of 3D origami forms have very similar shapes such as the superhero characters, but characteristics such as the color, the eyes, the clothes help to determine which superhero the origami piece represents.

# Minions
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/origami/minions.png" alt="minions">

* The minions themselves structurally are similar but you can adjust the height, the eyes, the hair to make different minion characters. Can you tell the names of these minions?
